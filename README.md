<h1>Installing Mabox Linux On A Chromebook</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a taking a 2016 Chromebook, which no longer receives security or OS updates, and bringing it back to life with a lightweight version of Manjora Linux called Mabox. We can do this by flashing the firmware. Then use Mabox installation media (USB drive) to install our new OS!
