<h1>Installing Mabox Linux On A Chromebook</h1>
<h2>The Why</h2>
<p></p>This device was left next to a dumpster in my mom's apartment complex. Apparently its previous owner didn't see any value in it. And I can see why. With only 4GB of RAM, a 16GB hard drive, and an outdated OS no longer supported by Google, I could see why it had been left behind.</p>

<p>When I created a new user to poke around the OS to see what it could do, I wasn't impressed. I couldn't even get my preferred VPN on there, because I was limited to the Google Play Store. However, its HDMI port (a feature my main device lacked) made it a perfect candidate for repurposing as a lightweight streaming and browsing device for my living room. By installing Mabox Linux, I aimed to free the device from its limitations and extend its functionality, security, and lifespan.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Project consists of a taking a 2016 Chromebook, which no longer receives [security] updates, and bringing it back to life with a lightweight version of Manjora Linux called Mabox. We can do this by flashing the firmware. Then use Mabox installation media (USB drive) to install our new OS!
